## Proactive vs. Reactive Quality Management
The job description emphasizes a proactive approach to quality, focusing on tools like PFMEA and initiatives during the New Product Development (NPD) stage. This highlights a critical industry shift from finding defects to preventing them. A reactive approach, which deals with issues only after they arise in mass production or reach the customer, is costly, inefficient, and damaging to the brand. This role is designed to embed quality into the product from the very beginning. By driving FAI (First Article Inspection) and Cpk (Process Capability Index) analysis, you are building a foundation of manufacturing excellence. Your success will be measured not by how many problems you solve, but by how many you prevent. This requires a strategic mindset, the ability to foresee potential failure points, and the tenacity to ensure that robust processes are implemented and followed. It's about influencing design for manufacturability, establishing rigorous supplier qualification processes, and ensuring that quality is a key consideration at every stage gate of the product lifecycle, not just a final inspection before shipment.

## 10 Typical Product Quality Manager Interview Questions

### Question 1：Can you describe a time you implemented a quality tool, like PFMEA or Cpk, at a supplier site? What was the situation, and what was the result?
*   **Points of Assessment**: This question assesses your hands-on experience with core quality methodologies, your ability to work with suppliers, and your impact on process improvement.
*   **Standard Answer**: "At my previous company, we were preparing to launch a new consumer electronic device. I noticed during early supplier audits that their process control for a critical housing component was not well-documented. I initiated a PFMEA workshop with their engineering and production teams to proactively identify potential failure modes. We identified three high-risk areas related to injection molding parameters. By implementing real-time statistical process control (SPC) and establishing Cpk targets, we were able to reduce the potential defect rate by 40% before mass production even began. This prevented a potential line-down situation and ensured a smooth product launch."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a purely theoretical answer without a concrete example; failing to quantify the impact of your actions (e.g., "it improved the process" vs. "it reduced defects by 40%").
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How did you get buy-in from the supplier to implement these changes?
