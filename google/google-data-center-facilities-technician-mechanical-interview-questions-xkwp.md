## 10 Typical Data Center Facilities Technician, Mechanical Interview Questions

### Question 1：Can you describe your experience with maintaining and troubleshooting large-scale HVAC systems, specifically chillers and air handling units?
*   **Points of Assessment**: The interviewer is assessing your hands-on technical experience with the core equipment you'll be working on. They want to gauge your familiarity with industrial-scale systems and your systematic approach to maintenance and troubleshooting.
*   **Standard Answer**: "In my previous role at [Previous Company], I was responsible for the daily operation and preventative maintenance of a 2,000-ton chilled water plant. This included four centrifugal chillers and over 30 CRAH units. My duties involved daily rounds, logging system parameters like pressure and temperature, and performing preventative maintenance based on the manufacturer's schedule. I have hands-on experience troubleshooting issues like low refrigerant flow, sensor failures, and fan motor problems. I would typically start by checking the Building Management System for alarms, then move to a physical inspection with tools like multimeters and pressure gauges to diagnose the root cause before proceeding with the repair."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a vague answer without mentioning specific equipment types or sizes. Failing to describe a logical troubleshooting process.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Tell me about the most complex mechanical failure you had to resolve.
    *   How do you use a Building Management System (BMS) in your daily work?
    *   What safety procedures do you follow when working on high-pressure refrigerant lines?

### Question 2：Imagine you receive an alarm for high temperatures in a specific data hall. Walk me through your immediate response and troubleshooting process.
*   **Points of Assessment**: This question evaluates your problem-solving skills, ability to work under pressure, and understanding of operational protocols in a critical environment. The interviewer wants to see if you prioritize safety and logical diagnosis.
*   **Standard Answer**: "My first action would be to acknowledge the alarm and immediately check the Building Management System to identify the exact location and severity of the temperature rise. I would check the status of the local cooling units, such as CRACs or CRAHUs, to see if any have failed or are in alarm. I would then proceed to the data hall, following all safety protocols for entry. Once inside, I would perform a visual inspection to check for obvious issues like blocked airflow or unusual noises. I would verify the status of the local cooling units on their control panels. If a unit has failed, I would follow our standard operating procedure to attempt a reset or diagnose the fault, while simultaneously communicating the situation to the operations center and the on-site lead."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Panicking or skipping steps in the diagnostic process. Failing to mention communication with the wider team.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What if the BMS is not accessible? What would you do?

*   **Points of Assessment**: The interviewer is testing your commitment to safety procedures and your knowledge of industry-standard practices like Lockout/Tagout (LOTO).
*   **Standard Answer**: "Before beginning any work on a pump motor, my absolute first step is to follow the Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedure. I would identify the correct breaker in the motor control center, de-energize it, and apply my personal lock and tag. I would then perform a start/stop test at the local disconnect to verify that the equipment is fully de-energized. I would also ensure the pump is isolated hydraulically by closing the necessary suction and discharge valves. I would wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), which could include safety glasses, gloves, and steel-toed boots, depending on the task. Finally, I would complete any required work permits before starting the repair."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to mention LOTO specifically. Not mentioning the verification step (testing for zero energy).
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What would you do if you found a piece of equipment that was not properly locked out?
    *   Describe your experience with confined space entry procedures.
    *   How do you assess risk before starting a non-routine task?
