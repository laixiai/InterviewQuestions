*   **Points of Assessment**：This question assesses your understanding of go-to-market strategy, competitive analysis, and your ability to think strategically about product launches. The interviewer wants to see how you would identify a target audience, position a product, and create a comprehensive launch plan.
*   **Standard Answer**："To launch a new Google product in a competitive market, I would first conduct a thorough market and competitive analysis to identify our unique value proposition. Next, I would define our target audience and create detailed user personas. Based on this, I would develop a clear and compelling product positioning and messaging strategy. The launch plan would be multi-phased, starting with a pre-launch phase to generate buzz through PR and influencer outreach.

*   **Standard Answer**："In my previous role, we noticed a decline in user engagement with our email marketing campaigns.

I then conducted an A/B test with different subject lines and content tailored to this segment.

For organic growth, I would start with pre-launch activities like building a landing page to collect email sign-ups and engaging with relevant online communities and forums. I would also leverage content marketing by creating blog posts and social media content that addresses the pain points of our target audience. For paid acquisition, I would run highly targeted ads on social media platforms where our target users are most active.
