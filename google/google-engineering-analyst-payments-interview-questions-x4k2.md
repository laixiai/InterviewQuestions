*   **Points of Assessment**: This question assesses your structured problem-solving approach, your data analysis skills, and your ability to form and test hypotheses under pressure.
*   **Standard Answer**: "My first step would be to validate the data to ensure the spike is real and not an anomaly in our logging or reporting systems. Next, I would begin segmenting the data to isolate the cause. I'd look for common patterns among the fraudulent transactions: are they linked to a specific set of merchants, a particular time of day, a new app version, or specific item types? I would use SQL to query our transaction logs, joining data from user, merchant, and payment tables to identify these correlations. Concurrently, I would check for any recent product launches or policy changes that might have unintentionally created a loophole. Finally, I would collaborate with on-the-ground teams, if available, to understand any local context and start formulating a hypothesis about the root cause, which I would then work to prove or disprove with further data analysis."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a generic answer without mentioning specific data points to investigate (e.g., merchant IDs, user agents, IP addresses). Failing to mention the initial step of data validation.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What specific SQL queries would you run to start this investigation?
    *   How would you differentiate between friendly fraud and a coordinated abuse attack?
