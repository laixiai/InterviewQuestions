After validating the issue with data, I scheduled a meeting with the responsible Product Manager. I framed the feedback not as a complaint, but as a shared problem, presenting the partner's data and direct quotes to illustrate the business impact. I focused on the 'why'—how fixing this would improve the product for a major user segment. By collaborating on a solution and acknowledging their workload, we were able to get the issue prioritized and resolved, which rebuilt the partner's trust."
