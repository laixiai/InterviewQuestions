## 10 Typical Data Scientist, Research Intern, PhD, Summer 2026 Interview Questions

### Question 1：You are given a large dataset of user search queries and clicks. How would you determine if a recent change to the search ranking algorithm improved user satisfaction?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Evaluates your understanding of experimental design (A/B testing).
    *   Assesses your ability to define relevant metrics for a vague concept like "user satisfaction."
    *   Tests your problem-solving skills in a real-world product context.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "To determine the impact on user satisfaction, I would propose an A/B test. We would randomly assign a portion of users to the new search ranking algorithm (the treatment group) and the rest to the old algorithm (the control group). I would define user satisfaction through a set of key metrics, such as Click-Through Rate (CTR) on the top results, the time to first click, and the rate of 'pogo-sticking' (clicking a result and immediately returning to the search page). I would also look at session-based outcomes, like the number of queries per session or task completion rates. I would then collect data over a defined period, ensuring we have enough statistical power, and use hypothesis testing to determine if there is a statistically significant improvement in these metrics for the treatment group compared to the control."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Failing to mention A/B testing or another controlled experimental framework.
    *   Suggesting only simple metrics (like overall CTR) without considering the nuances of user behavior.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What potential biases could affect this experiment?
    *   How would you determine the necessary sample size or duration for the experiment?
    *   What if the new algorithm improves one metric (e.g., CTR) but degrades another (e.g., session length)?

### Question 2：Describe a complex data analysis project you've worked on, from problem formulation to final conclusions.
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Assesses your ability to structure and communicate your past research or project work.
    *   Evaluates your practical experience with the end-to-end data analysis process.
    *   Shows your ability to explain technical concepts clearly and concisely.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "During my PhD research, I worked on a project to predict patient readmission rates for a specific condition using hospital administrative data. The problem was to identify high-risk patients who could benefit from intervention. I began by defining the prediction window and gathering relevant features, including patient demographics, clinical history, and previous hospital visit patterns. I performed extensive data cleaning and feature engineering, handling missing values and creating interaction terms. I then experimented with several models, including logistic regression and gradient boosting machines, using cross-validation to evaluate their performance. The gradient boosting model performed best, and I used SHAP values to interpret the key factors driving predictions, such as the number of prior admissions and specific comorbidities. My final conclusion was a deployable model and a set of interpretable risk factors that clinicians could use."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Providing a disorganized or rambling description of the project.
    *   Focusing only on the modeling part without mentioning data cleaning, feature engineering, or interpretation.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Why did you choose that specific model? What were its limitations?
    *   How did you handle missing data, and what was the rationale for your approach?
    *   How did you validate your final results?

### Question 3：Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization and their respective use cases.
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests your fundamental knowledge of core statistical and machine learning concepts.
    *   Assesses your understanding of model complexity and overfitting.
    *   Evaluates your ability to explain technical trade-offs.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "L1 and L2 regularization are techniques used to prevent overfitting in models like linear regression by adding a penalty term to the cost function. The L1 penalty, or Lasso, adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, while the L2 penalty, or Ridge, adds the sum of the squared values. The key difference in their effect is that L1 can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by removing irrelevant features from the model. L2, on the other hand, shrinks coefficients towards zero but rarely sets them to exactly zero. Therefore, I would use L1 regularization when I have a high-dimensional dataset and suspect many features are irrelevant. I would use L2 when I believe most features are useful and want to prevent multicollinearity and reduce model complexity without eliminating features."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Confusing which penalty corresponds to which name (Lasso vs. Ridge).
    *   Being unable to explain the practical difference regarding feature selection.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Can you write down the cost function for Ridge regression?
    *   What is the Elastic Net regularization, and when would you use it?
    *   How do you choose the regularization parameter, lambda?

### Question 4：How would you handle a dataset with a significant amount of missing values?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Evaluates your practical data preprocessing skills.
    *   Tests your understanding of the potential biases introduced by different imputation methods.
    *   Assesses your critical thinking about the nature of the missing data.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "My approach would depend on the nature and extent of the missing data. First, I would investigate *why* the data is missing. Is it missing completely at random (MCAR), at random (MAR), or not at random (MNAR)? For MCAR or MAR, I have several options. If the percentage of missing values in a column is very high, I might drop the column. If only a few rows are missing data, I could drop those rows. For imputation, simple methods include mean, median, or mode imputation, but these can reduce variance. More sophisticated methods include regression imputation or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation, where you predict the missing value based on other features. For time-series data, I might use forward or backward fill. If the missingness is MNAR, the fact that a value is missing is informative itself, and I might create a binary feature to indicate whether the value was missing."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Immediately stating a single method (e.g., "I would use mean imputation") without discussing the context.
    *   Failing to discuss the importance of understanding the mechanism of missingness.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What are the disadvantages of mean imputation?
    *   How would you implement a KNN imputation model?
    *   Can you explain the difference between MAR and MNAR?

### Question 5：You are working with a product manager who wants to understand why a key user engagement metric has suddenly dropped. How would you investigate this?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests your analytical and structured thinking process.
    *   Evaluates your ability to break down a vague problem into a concrete plan.
    *   Assesses your cross-functional collaboration and communication skills.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "I would start by clarifying the problem with the product manager. I'd ask for the exact definition of the metric, the time frame of the drop, and the magnitude. My investigation would follow a structured approach. First, I'd check for internal factors: was there a new feature release, a code change, or a marketing campaign that ended around the time of the drop? I would analyze the data by segments to see if the drop is universal or isolated to a specific user group (e.g., new vs. returning users), geographic region, device type, or platform (iOS vs. Android). Next, I'd look for external factors, such as competitor actions, holidays, or major news events. I would analyze related metrics to see if they were also affected. Throughout the process, I would communicate my preliminary findings to the product manager and collaborate with engineers to rule out any data logging or technical bugs."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Jumping to conclusions without a structured investigation plan.
    *   Forgetting to consider internal factors like recent product changes or bugs.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you differentiate between correlation and causation in your findings?
    *   What kind of data visualizations would be most effective for presenting your analysis?
    *   What would you do if you couldn't find a clear cause for the drop?

### Question 6：Explain the bias-variance trade-off. How does it apply to a model like a decision tree?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests your understanding of a fundamental concept in machine learning.
    *   Assesses your ability to connect theoretical concepts to practical model behavior.
    *   Evaluates your knowledge of model tuning.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "The bias-variance trade-off is a core concept in supervised learning that describes the relationship between model complexity, and its prediction error on new data. Bias is the error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm; high bias can cause a model to underfit, missing relevant relations between features and outputs. Variance is the error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set; high variance can cause a model to overfit, modeling the random noise in the training data. For a decision tree, the trade-off is very clear. A shallow tree with few nodes is a high-bias, low-variance model; it makes simple assumptions and is unlikely to overfit. As you increase the depth of the tree, the model becomes more complex, its bias decreases, but its variance increases, as it can fit the training data more closely, capturing noise."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Inaccurately defining bias or variance.
    *   Being unable to provide a concrete example of how it applies to a specific algorithm.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How do ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting manage the bias-variance trade-off?
    *   What specific hyperparameters in a decision tree would you tune to control this trade-off?
    *   How does the trade-off manifest differently in a linear model versus a tree-based model?

### Question 7：How would you explain p-value to a non-technical stakeholder?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Assesses your communication skills, specifically your ability to simplify complex topics.
    *   Tests your fundamental understanding of statistical inference.
    *   Evaluates your ability to use analogies to convey meaning.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "I would explain it using an analogy. Imagine we're testing a new website design to see if it gets more clicks than the old one. The 'null hypothesis' is the assumption that the new design makes no difference; it's like assuming a defendant is 'innocent until proven guilty.' We run an experiment and collect data. The p-value is the probability of seeing the results we saw, or even more extreme results, *if the new design actually had no effect*. A small p-value, typically less than 0.05, is like finding strong evidence. It means it's very unlikely we would see this outcome by pure chance if the new design was ineffective. Therefore, we can be more confident in rejecting the 'no effect' assumption and concluding that our new design likely had a real impact."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Giving a technically correct but jargon-filled definition that the stakeholder wouldn't understand.
    *   Incorrectly defining the p-value as "the probability that the null hypothesis is true."
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What is statistical significance, and how does it relate to the p-value?
    *   What are the limitations or potential misinterpretations of the p-value?
    *   What is a confidence interval, and how would you explain that?

### Question 8：Given a dataset of transactions, how would you build a model to detect fraudulent activity?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests your approach to a classic data science problem.
    *   Evaluates your understanding of working with imbalanced datasets.
    *   Assesses your feature engineering and model selection thought process.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "First, I'd recognize that this is a classification problem, likely with a highly imbalanced dataset where fraud is rare. My initial step would be feature engineering. I'd create features like transaction frequency for a user, average transaction amount, time of day, location, and comparisons to a user's historical behavior. Handling the class imbalance is critical. I wouldn't use accuracy as a metric; instead, I'd focus on Precision, Recall, and the F1-score or look at the ROC curve and AUC. To train the model, I could use techniques like oversampling the minority class (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling the majority class. I would likely start with a model that performs well on imbalanced data, such as a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, and potentially an anomaly detection algorithm like Isolation Forest to see if it can identify unusual patterns."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Forgetting to mention the class imbalance problem, which is central to fraud detection.
    *   Suggesting accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What is the difference between precision and recall? Which might be more important for fraud detection?
    *   How does the SMOTE algorithm work?
    *   How would you deploy this model in a real-time system?

### Question 9：You have two models. Model A has a higher accuracy on the test set, but Model B is much simpler and more interpretable. Which one would you choose to deploy and why?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Evaluates your understanding that model performance is not the only factor in deployment.
    *   Assesses your business acumen and ability to consider factors like maintainability and trust.
    *   Tests your ability to reason through a decision with trade-offs.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "The choice depends heavily on the business context and the stakes of the decision. If the model is being used for a high-risk application, such as in finance or healthcare, or if we need to explain the model's decisions to regulators or users, I would lean towards Model B. Interpretability is crucial for building trust, debugging, and ensuring fairness. The cost of a wrong but explainable decision might be lower than a slightly more accurate but black-box prediction. However, if the application is low-risk, like product recommendations, and the small accuracy gain from Model A translates to a significant business uplift, then deploying the more complex model could be justified. I would perform a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the performance gain against the costs of lower interpretability and higher maintenance for Model A before making a final decision."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Automatically choosing the model with the highest accuracy without considering any other factors.
    *   Failing to ask for more context about the problem before answering.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Can you give an example of a situation where you would absolutely choose interpretability over accuracy?
    *   What techniques could you use to help explain the predictions of a more complex, "black-box" model?
    *   How would you quantify the business impact of a 1% increase in accuracy?

### Question 10：What is a research area in statistics or machine learning that you are currently interested in?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Shows your passion for the field and your commitment to continuous learning.
    *   Evaluates your awareness of current trends and research frontiers.
    *   Gives the interviewer insight into your intellectual curiosity.
*   **Standard Answer**:
    "I'm particularly interested in the field of causal inference and its application in industry settings. While predictive models are powerful for forecasting, many business questions are fundamentally causal—for example, 'What is the true effect of a marketing campaign on sales, after accounting for confounding factors?' I'm fascinated by techniques like propensity score matching, instrumental variables, and uplift modeling that go beyond correlation to estimate causation from observational data. In a company like Google, with vast amounts of observational user data, being able to rigorously infer causal relationships could unlock significant value and lead to better decision-making for product development and business strategy. I have been following research on how these methods can be scaled and applied to complex, high-dimensional systems."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Saying you are not interested in any specific area.
    *   Mentioning a very common or outdated topic without adding any personal insight or depth.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Can you explain the difference between a randomized experiment and an observational study for determining causality?
    *   How would you apply a causal inference technique to a problem here at Google?
    *   What are some of the key challenges in applying causal inference methods to real-world data?
