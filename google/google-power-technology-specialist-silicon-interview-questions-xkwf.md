For performance, you need a low-impedance network across a wide frequency range to minimize voltage droop, which often requires a large amount of decoupling capacitance and a dense power grid. However, this directly conflicts with area and cost, as capacitors consume valuable silicon real estate and a dense grid can lead to routing congestion. There is also a trade-off between on-die, package, and board-level decoupling solutions. You have to optimize this entire system to meet the impedance target for each power domain without exceeding the area or cost budget.
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Only mentioning one or two trade-offs. Not being able to explain the "why" behind the trade-offs (e.g., why low impedance is important). Discussing the trade-offs in abstract terms without linking them to physical design choices.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How do you decide the optimal mix of on-die vs. package capacitance?
    *   How does the choice of process technology affect PDN design?

*   **Standard Answer**: Evaluating technology from a startup requires a different approach than with an established vendor. While the potential for a breakthrough is high, so is the risk. I would start with an even deeper technical due diligence, focusing on the fundamental physics and validating their core claims with our own simulations. I'd also assess the team's expertise and their development methodology. The key is to de-risk the technology through a phased engagement. This might start with a small-scale proof-of-concept project or a test chip implementation before committing to integrating it into a major product. This allows us to learn and validate while containing the potential impact of any failures.
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Being overly optimistic and ignoring the risks. Being overly conservative and unwilling to consider new technologies. Not having a clear strategy for risk mitigation.

As we shrink process nodes, the operating voltages decrease, but the power consumption increases, leading to massive current demands. Delivering hundreds of amps with millivolt-level precision is an enormous challenge for the entire PDN, from the voltage regulator down to the silicon. Another significant challenge will be the co-design of power delivery and thermal solutions. You can no longer design them in isolation; efficient heat removal will be just as critical as efficient power delivery to enable next-generation performance.
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Mentioning current challenges without looking to the future. Giving a vague or generic answer about "things getting smaller." Failing to connect the challenges back to specific applications or technology trends.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What role will new materials, like GaN or SiC, play in addressing these challenges?
    *   How will advanced packaging technologies, like 3D integration, impact power delivery?
    *   What new design methodologies will be needed to tackle these problems?
