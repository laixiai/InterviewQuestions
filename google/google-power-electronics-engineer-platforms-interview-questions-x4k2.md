*   **Points of Assessment**: Assesses the candidate's practical experience in DC/DC converter design, their understanding of power conversion topologies, and their ability to analyze trade-offs between efficiency, size, cost, and thermal performance.
*   **Standard Answer**: "In a previous project, I designed a two-stage 48V-to-1V DC/DC converter for a server motherboard. The first stage was a non-isolated buck converter to step down from 48V to an intermediate 12V bus, optimized for high efficiency. The second stage consisted of multiple parallel point-of-load (PoL) buck converters for the final 1V conversion, which improved transient response for the processor. The key trade-off was between efficiency and power density. A single-stage conversion would be smaller but less efficient due to the extreme duty cycle. The two-stage approach improved overall efficiency but required more board space and components. We carefully selected MOSFETs with low Rds(on) and optimized the layout to minimize parasitic inductance, ultimately achieving over 95% peak efficiency."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a purely theoretical answer without specific project details; failing to clearly articulate the reasons behind design choices; neglecting to mention thermal management considerations.

My approach was to first characterize the problem by monitoring all key voltage rails and temperatures. I started at the system input and worked my way down to the point-of-load converters. Using an oscilloscope, I observed significant voltage droop on the 12V intermediate bus during load transients. This led me to suspect insufficient bulk capacitance or a stability issue with the upstream converter. By adding more bulk capacitance near the PoL converters, the droop was mitigated, and the system became stable. The root cause was an underestimation of the processor's peak current demand during the initial design phase."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Describing a simple, component-level failure instead of a system-level one; jumping to conclusions without a logical process; failing to explain the tools and measurements used.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:

    *   Describe a time you faced resistance from a cross-functional team member and how you handled it.

### Question 5：Explain the importance of Power Delivery Network (PDN) impedance. How do you design a low-impedance PDN?
*   **Points of Assessment**: Probes the candidate's understanding of power integrity fundamentals, which are critical for high-performance computing platforms.
*   **Standard Answer**: "The PDN impedance is critical because it determines the voltage droop in response to transient load currents. A high impedance can cause significant voltage fluctuations, leading to timing errors and system instability. To design a low-impedance PDN, I use a multi-pronged approach. First, I ensure a solid ground plane and use wide power planes in the PCB layout to minimize resistive and inductive parasitics. Second, I use a carefully planned decoupling capacitor network, with different capacitor types (bulk, ceramic) placed strategically to provide low impedance across a wide frequency range. Placing high-frequency decoupling caps as close as possible to the IC power pins is essential. Finally, I use PDN simulation tools to analyze the impedance profile and ensure it meets the target for the given load."

*   **Points of Assessment**: Evaluates strategic thinking and the ability to make sound engineering decisions based on high-level business and operational goals.
*   **Standard Answer**: "Analyzing these trade-offs requires a holistic view. For performance, I focus on efficiency and transient response. Higher efficiency reduces operational costs (electricity and cooling) but may require more expensive components. For cost, I consider both the bill of materials (BOM) and the total cost of ownership (TCO). Reliability is assessed through metrics like MTBF and by designing with sufficient margin and derating components. Availability is often achieved through redundancy, like N+1 power supplies, which increases cost and complexity but is critical for data center uptime. The right balance depends on the application. For a critical Tier 1 service, availability and reliability are paramount, while for other systems, cost might be a stronger driver."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a vague answer without mentioning specific metrics (e.g., TCO, MTBF); failing to connect technical decisions to business impact; discussing only one or two aspects of the trade-off.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you quantify the TCO of two different power solutions?
    *   Give an example of a design choice where you prioritized reliability over cost.
    *   How does the scale of a data center impact these trade-off decisions?

*   **Points of Assessment**: Tests hands-on lab skills, practical experience, and the ability to work methodically and safely with high-power electronics.
*   **Standard Answer**: "My board bring-up process is very systematic and safety-focused. First, I perform a thorough visual inspection and check for shorts on all major power rails. Then, I power up the board with a current-limited supply, starting with a low voltage and gradually increasing it while monitoring the input current. I test the auxiliary and control power supplies first before enabling the main power stage. Once the low-power sections are confirmed to be working, I enable the main converter at no-load and verify the output voltage and switching waveforms. The next step is to apply a light load using an electronic load and gradually increase it, monitoring efficiency and thermal performance. A key challenge is managing unexpected behavior like oscillations or component overheating, which requires careful debugging with an oscilloscope and other lab equipment."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Not mentioning safety precautions (like using a current-limited supply); describing a disorganized "plug and pray" approach; failing to mention key verification steps like checking waveforms and thermal performance.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What is the first thing you do if you see excessive current draw on initial power-up?
    *   How do you test the transient response of your converter in the lab?
    *   What safety procedures do you follow when working with high voltages?

*   **Points of Assessment**: Tests fundamental knowledge of power electronics theory, which is the bedrock of all design work in this role.
*   **Standard Answer**: "Certainly. A buck converter is a step-down DC-DC converter; its output voltage is always lower than the input. It's widely used for point-of-load regulation, such as creating a 1V core voltage from a 12V bus. A boost converter is a step-up converter, producing an output voltage higher than the input. You might see this in applications like battery-powered systems where a higher voltage rail is needed. A buck-boost converter can produce an output voltage that is either higher or lower than the input, and it's typically inverting. This is useful in applications where the input voltage can vary widely, such as in automotive electronics. The choice of topology depends entirely on the required voltage conversion ratio and application constraints."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Confusing the functions of the topologies; being unable to provide practical application examples; failing to explain the basic operating principles (i.e., the role of the inductor and switch).
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How does the duty cycle relate to the output voltage in each of these converters?
    *   What are the advantages and disadvantages of a non-inverting buck-boost topology like a SEPIC converter?
    *   Can you draw the basic schematic for a synchronous buck converter and explain its advantages?
