*   **Standard Answer**: "In a previous project, we were tasked with building a new data processing pipeline, but the downstream consumers hadn't finalized their data format requirements. To manage this ambiguity, I started by establishing a clear, foundational architecture based on flexible, well-defined interfaces. I worked with my team to identify the core, non-negotiable components and the parts that would need to adapt. We used a modular design so that changes to the output format would not require a complete rewrite. I scheduled regular check-ins with the product and stakeholder teams to manage expectations and communicate our iterative progress. This approach allowed us to build the core infrastructure confidently while isolating the uncertain parts, ultimately enabling us to deliver on time once the requirements were finalized."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a vague answer without a specific example; describing a situation where you waited for perfect clarity instead of taking proactive steps; failing to mention communication with stakeholders.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How did you decide which architectural principles to enforce?
    *   What was the most significant technical trade-off you had to make?
    *   How did you keep your team motivated when the requirements were in flux?

    *   How do you measure the success of your mentorship?

### Question 3：Tell me about a time you identified a significant technical risk in a project. What steps did you take to mitigate it?
*   **Points of Assessment**: Probes your project management skills, technical foresight, and ability to communicate complex issues to stakeholders.
*   **Standard Answer**: "We were developing a new distributed service that relied on a third-party API with an unknown performance ceiling. I identified this as a major risk to our scalability and reliability goals. My first step was to quantify the risk by leading my team in creating a prototype to benchmark the API's latency and throughput under load. The results confirmed our fears. I immediately presented these findings to project stakeholders with a clear explanation of the potential impact. I then proposed a two-pronged mitigation strategy: first, to build a caching layer to reduce our dependency on the API for frequent requests, and second, to design a graceful degradation mechanism, like a circuit breaker, to handle API failures without bringing our entire service down. This proactive approach prevented a potential launch-day disaster."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Discussing a minor risk; only identifying the risk but not taking ownership of the solution; failing to communicate the risk and its impact to stakeholders.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How did you convince stakeholders to invest resources in this mitigation?
    *   What other alternative solutions did you consider?

*   **Points of Assessment**: Tests your technical expertise in large-scale system design, your understanding of distributed systems principles, and your ability to make reasoned technical trade-offs.
*   **Standard Answer**: "For a large-scale logging system, I'd start with the core requirements: high throughput, low latency ingestion, durability, and scalable query capabilities. The architecture would begin with lightweight agents on each server shipping logs to a collection tier. This tier, likely built with something like Kafka, would act as a durable, distributed buffer to handle bursts of traffic. From Kafka, a stream processing layer using a framework like Flink or Spark Streaming would parse, enrich, and index the logs. The processed logs would then be persisted into a search-optimized database like Elasticsearch for real-time querying and analysis. Finally, a visualization layer like Kibana or Grafana would provide user-facing dashboards. Key considerations throughout the design would be data partitioning, replication for fault tolerance, and backpressure mechanisms to ensure stability."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Jumping straight into specific technologies without discussing requirements and trade-offs; designing a system that doesn't scale; ignoring aspects like durability, fault tolerance, and monitoring.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you ensure that no log messages are lost?
    *   How would you handle a sudden 10x spike in log volume?
    *   What's the trade-off between using Kafka versus a direct-to-database approach?

### Question 5：Describe a situation where you had to manage a low-performing engineer. What was your approach?
*   **Points of Assessment**: Assesses your people management skills, specifically your ability to handle difficult conversations, provide constructive feedback, and manage performance effectively.
