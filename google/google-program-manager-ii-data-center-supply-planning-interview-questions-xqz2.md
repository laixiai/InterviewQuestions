    *   What was the biggest challenge you faced in getting stakeholders to adopt the new process?
    *   How did you measure the success of this process improvement?
    *   If you could do it again, what would you do differently?

### Question 3：How would you approach developing an inventory strategy for critical data center components?
*   **Points of Assessment**: This assesses your strategic thinking regarding inventory management and your understanding of balancing cost, service levels, and risk.
*   **Standard Answer**: "My approach would be data-driven and segmented. First, I would classify components based on factors like cost, lead time, demand variability, and criticality to operations (ABC/XYZ analysis). For high-value, critical components with long lead times, I would establish strategic buffers and explore multi-sourcing options to mitigate risk. For lower-cost, more predictable items, I would use a more automated, lean replenishment model. I would then use statistical analysis to set optimal safety stock levels, balancing the cost of inventory against the cost of a stockout. This strategy would be regularly reviewed and adjusted based on changing demand patterns, supplier performance, and evolving business goals."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Suggesting a one-size-fits-all inventory policy. Not mentioning data analysis as the basis for the strategy. Forgetting to consider factors like lead time or demand volatility.

    *   How would you convince a supplier to invest in more capacity for you?
    *   How do you balance the speed of a solution versus its long-term viability?
    *   What role would the finance team play in this decision-making process?

### Question 7：How have you used data and statistical analysis to drive a key planning decision?
*   **Points of Assessment**: This directly tests the "Preferred Qualification" of analytical skills and your ability to make data-motivated decisions.
*   **Standard Answer**: "We were consistently holding excess inventory for a particular product family, leading to high carrying costs. I performed a detailed analysis of 18 months of historical demand data and found that the demand was highly seasonal, a factor our previous static safety stock model didn't account for. Using statistical analysis, I developed a new seasonal inventory policy that increased stock levels ahead of the peak season and significantly reduced them during the off-peak. I presented my findings, including the projected savings in holding costs versus the minimal risk of stockouts, to management. After implementing the new policy, we reduced average inventory for that product family by 25% while maintaining our 99% service level."
