    *   Evaluates your ability to design complex, large-scale distributed systems.
    *   Tests your understanding of integrating AI/ML models with traditional database systems.
    *   Assesses your strategic thinking about data collection, model inference, and feedback loops.
*   **Standard Answer**: My approach would be a decoupled, event-driven architecture. First, I would establish a non-intrusive data pipeline to collect performance metrics, query logs, and execution plans from the distributed database nodes. This data would be streamed into a centralized data lake for preprocessing and feature engineering. The core of the system would be an "Inference Service" that hosts the fine-tuned Gemini model. This service would periodically analyze the collected data to identify anti-patterns or optimization opportunities. When a potential improvement is found, the service generates a recommendation, including the reasoning and projected impact. This recommendation is then pushed to a "Recommendation Engine," which surfaces it to the user via an API or a dedicated UI in the Google Cloud Console. A crucial component is a feedback loop, allowing users to accept or reject suggestions, which retrains and improves the model over time.
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Proposing a tightly coupled architecture that could impact the database's performance.
    *   Ignoring the challenges of data privacy, security, and the cost of running inference at scale.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you handle potentially sensitive data in the query logs?
    *   What strategies would you use to fine-tune the Gemini model for this specific task?

*   **Standard Answer**: I would design a multi-agent system. The "Planner Agent" would be the conductor, receiving the high-level goal, such as 'add a new indexed column to the users table'. This agent, powered by an LLM, would break the task into smaller steps. It would then invoke a "Schema Analysis Agent" to understand the current schema, dependencies, and potential locking issues. Next, a "Code Generation Agent" would write the necessary DDL scripts and corresponding data backfill jobs. A critical "Validation Agent" would then execute these scripts in a staging environment, running a suite of predefined tests to verify correctness and measure performance impact. Only after successful validation would the Planner Agent schedule the migration during a low-traffic window, monitored by a "Execution Agent" that can initiate an automated rollback if it detects anomalies.
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Underestimating the complexity and risks of automating schema changes.
    *   Designing a monolithic system instead of a modular, agent-based one.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
