*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What types of chillers are you most familiar with?
    *   What was the most significant outage you had to respond to?
    *   How did you use a CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) in your previous role?

### Question 2：Walk me through the basic refrigeration cycle as it applies to a data center chiller.
*   **Points of Assessment**: This question tests your fundamental technical knowledge of HVAC systems, which are central to the role. It assesses your ability to explain a core concept clearly and accurately.
*   **Standard Answer**: "Certainly. The cycle begins with the compressor, which pressurizes low-pressure refrigerant gas, causing its temperature to rise. This hot, high-pressure gas then flows to the condenser, where it releases heat to either the outside air or a water loop and condenses into a high-pressure liquid. Next, this liquid passes through an expansion valve, which causes a sudden drop in pressure and temperature, turning it into a cold, low-pressure liquid-vapor mix. This cold refrigerant then enters the evaporator, which is where the cooling happens. It absorbs heat from the data center's water loop, causing the refrigerant to evaporate back into a low-pressure gas. This chilled water is then pumped to the CRAH units in the data hall, and the low-pressure refrigerant gas returns to the compressor to start the cycle over again."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Confusing the order of the components (compressor, condenser, expansion valve, evaporator). Inability to explain the state of the refrigerant (gas/liquid, high/low pressure) at each stage.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What is the function of a TXV (Thermostatic Expansion Valve)?
    *   How does a water-cooled condenser differ from an air-cooled one?
